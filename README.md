## SilentDragonLite CLI - A command line Hush light client. 

`silentdragonlite-cli` is a command line SilentDragonLite light client. To use it, download the latest binary from the releases page and run `./silentdragonlite-cli`

This will launch the interactive prompt. Type `help` to get a list of commands

## Running in non-interactive mode:
You can also run `silentdragonlite-cli` in non-interactive mode by passing the command you want to run as an argument. For example, `silentdragonlite-cli addresses` will list all wallet addresses and exit. 
Run `silentdragonlite-cli help` to see a list of all commands. 

## Privacy 
* While all the keys and transaction detection happens on the client, the server can learn what blocks contain your shielded transactions.
* The server also learns other metadata about you like your ip address etc...
* Also remember that t-addresses don't provide any privacy protection.

## Notes:
* If you want to run your own server, please see [SilentDragonLite-cli lightwalletd](https://github.com/MyHush/lightwalletd), and then run `./silentdragonlite-cli --server http://127.0.0.1:9069`. You might also need to pass `--dangerous` if you are using a self-signed  TLS certificate.

* The log file is in `~/.silentdragonlite/silentdragonlite-cli.debug.log`. Wallet is stored in `~/.silentdragonlite/silentdragonlite-cli.dat`

### Note Management
silentdragonlite does automatic note and utxo management, which means it doesn't allow you to manually select which address to send outgoing transactions from. It follows these principles:
* Defaults to sending shielded transactions, even if you're sending to a transparent address
* Sapling funds need at least 5 confirmations before they can be spent
* Can select funds from multiple shielded addresses in the same transaction
* Will automatically shield your transparent funds at the first opportunity
    * When sending an outgoing transaction to a shielded address, silentdragonlite can decide to use the transaction to additionally shield your transparent funds (i.e., send your transparent funds to your own shielded address in the same transaction)

## Compiling from source
